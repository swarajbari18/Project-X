A.2. Proofs
Proof of Theorem 2. Let σ = (a1 , . . . , aT ) be accepted by prefix tree P, visiting states q0 , q1 , . . . , qT with δ(qi , ai+1 ) =
qi+1 . Let [q] = κ(q) denote the class of q under the last-activity merge (its incoming activity, with [q0 ] = init).
Step 1 (Edges survive). The merged transition function collects every trie edge: δM ([q], a) = [a] whenever some trie edge
labelled a leaves a member of [q]. In particular the trie edge δ(qi , ai+1 ) = qi+1 gives δM ([qi ], ai+1 ) = [ai+1 ] = [qi+1 ],
since the incoming activity of qi+1 is ai+1 .
Step 2 (Acceptance). Apply δM along σ:
                                                          a 1        2 a       T   a
                                                     [q0 ] −→ [q1 ] −→ · · · −−→ [qT ].

Every transition exists by Step 1, so σ is accepted by M.
Step 3 filtering may subsequently remove a transition whose aggregated count is one, unless it is its source’s only continuation;
this is the only mechanism by which a trace fails to replay, and the replay-fitness columns of Table 1 measure exactly this
cost.

Proof of Theorem 3. Let κ(q) denote the activity on the edge entering trie state q, with κ(qε ) = init for the root: the
congruence merges q ∼ q ′ iff κ(q) = κ(q ′ ), so the classes are exactly the |A| + 1 values of κ.
                                           a
Determinism. A quotient edge [u] −
                                 → [ua] exists iff some training trace contains the bigram (κ(u), a): the target class
is κ(ua) = a, which is determined by the input symbol a alone, so each ([u], a) has at most one target and the FSM is
deterministic.
Transitions. A class carries the union of its members’ out-edges, so merging only adds transitions; every trie path survives
the merge, and before filtering every training trace is accepted by Theorem 2. Step 3 then drops each transition whose
aggregated count is one unless it is its source’s only continuation; this removes edges, never states.
Uniqueness. Both the class map κ and the edge set (the retained observed bigrams; Step 3 thresholds on their counts) are
functions of the multiset of training transitions alone, hence invariant to trace order and to which traces are drawn from
a fixed corpus. The extracted FSM is therefore unique: this is the directly-follows automaton of D; it is not the minimal

                                                                       14

DFA of the finite prefix language LP (which is acyclic), but it is the compact acceptor whose states track the most recent

Proof of Proposition 5. Let e1 , . . . , ek be the k transitions of M∗ , with pj = Pr[ej appears in a random trace] ≥ pmin .
After N i.i.d. traces:
                                       Pr[ej not observed] = (1 − pj )N ≤ e−N pmin ,                                        (6)
                                                                     −N pmin

Setting the right-hand side ≤ δ and solving:
                                                              1          
                                                    N ≥            ln k/δ .
                                                        pmin
When all transitions are observed, the prefix tree contains every transition of M∗ , and the directly-follows quotient
(Theorem 3) yields M∗ .
Proposition 6 (Transition estimator consistency and concentration). Let P ∗ (· | q) denote the true transition distribution at
state q under an i.i.d. trace distribution, let nq be the number of state-visit observations, and let α ∈ (0, 1]. For any ϵ > 0,
                                                                                               nq ϵ2
                               h                                            i                       

                                                                      +α|A|    ≤  2|A| exp   −  2      .                     (8)

The smoothing bias vanishes as nq → ∞, and ∥P̂ − P ∗ ∥TV → 0 almost surely. (Proof: Bretagnolle–Huber + Bernstein
argument applied to multinomial transition counts.)
Corollary 7 (Surprise as log-likelihood ratio). Suppose success and failure traces are generated by FSM-structured mixtures
P + (· | q), P − (·
                 P| q) on the same state space. The trace cross-entropy computed from a success-only transition model,
CE+ (τ ) = T1 t − log2 P̂ + (at | qt ), is a consistent estimator (in nq ) of the expected per-step negative log-likelihood
under P + . Consequently, the per-trace surprise difference CE− (τ ) − CE+ (τ ) is a Neyman–Pearson-optimal statistic for
                                                      √
distinguishing success from failure traces up to O(1/ nq ) error.
Proposition 8 (Online monitoring regret). Consider the runtime P monitor that replays a trace τ of length    T through the
FSM, maintains the cumulative log-likelihood ratio Lt (τ ) = s≤t log P̂ − (as | qs ) − log P̂ + (as | qs ) computed from nq
                                                                                                          

Corollary 7 with per-step log-ratio bounded by B, the online decision rule attains expected regret

against the best state-dependent threshold policy in hindsight, where ℓ is any B-Lipschitz loss (e.g., cost-weighted misclassi-
fication). The first term is the multi-armed-bandit regret over |Q| candidate state-specific thresholds (Azuma–Hoeffding on
the martingale Lt ); the second is the plug-in estimation error from Proposition 6.

The bound has two practical consequences: (i) regret is sub-linear in T , so the monitor
                                                                                    p catches failures faster than repeatedly
relearning per-trace statistics. (ii) Compact |Q| (our FSMs use 7–43 states) makes log |Q| small, while RPNI’s |Q| ∼ 103 –
105 inflates both terms. Empirically, this matches Section 4.3: the combined cycle-rate + unique-state rule achieves
F1 √
   = 0.904 on SWE-agent and flags failures at 32% completion, consistent with the sub-linear-regret early-stopping the
O( T ) bound guarantees.

A.3. Complexity Analysis
We detail the runtime of the three steps. Step 1 (prefix tree): inserting N traces of mean length T̄ costs O(N T̄ ) time and
space, since each symbol extends a trie node via hash-map lookup. Step 2 (last-activity merge): we map each trie node to the
class of its incoming activity in a single pass, aggregating trie-edge counts into a (class, symbol, class) transition multiset.
The pass merges all nodes reached by the same activity, giving |A| + 1 classes. Step 3 (rare-transition filtering): one sweep
over the aggregated transitions, at most O(|A|2 ), negligible against the trie passes. The construction visits every node once
and inspects each outgoing edge, giving O(|QP | · |A|) worst-case time, where |QP | is the number of prefix-tree states.
Because |QP | ≤ N T̄ , the total construction time is O(N T̄ · |A|). In practice, |A| ≤ 42 across all twelve datasets and the
hash-map constant is small; we build all FSMs in <110 ms on a single CPU core (Table 13), compared to 7–36 s for RPNI.

(CLICK, TYPE, SELECT, etc.).

tau2-bench (Barres et al., 2025) extends tau-bench with multi-model evaluation across three domains: airline (800 traces,
17 activities), retail (1,824 traces, 18 activities), and telecom (1,824 traces, 42 activities). Each domain contains traces from
4 LLMs (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1-mini, o4-mini). Activities are extracted from tool calls[].name. The
telecom domain introduces a richer tool vocabulary (42 activities including network diagnostics, SIM operations, billing)
than any other dataset, producing our largest FSM (43 states).

WebArena (Zhou et al., 2024) is a benchmark of realistic web tasks (shopping, forums, maps, GitLab); we use 8,337
agent traces (rollouts). Activities are 12 normalized action types (click, type, scroll down, etc.) combined with
role prefixes, yielding |A|=24 activity symbols. Labels derive from task completion status (13.4% success). This is our
largest labeled dataset by trace count and produces the lowest compression ratio (15×) because short web interaction traces
(median 5 steps) give RPNI limited opportunity to overfit.

AgentNet (Wang et al., 2025c) provides desktop computer-use agent trajectories; we use a 5,000-trace sample from the
OpenCUA Ubuntu subset, covering GUI automation across diverse applications. Activities are extracted from pyautogui
action primitives (click, typewrite, hotkey, screenshot, moveTo, etc.), yielding 24 activities. Labels derive
from task completion annotations (36.4% success). This dataset produces the second-highest compression ratio (2,500×)
due to its large training set (4,000 traces) and diverse action vocabulary.

SWE-agent (Yang et al., 2024) provides coding agent trajectories in Parquet format (80,036 available); we use a 2,000-
trace sample. Raw commands are extracted from code blocks in assistant messages and grouped into 7 actor categories:
search, navigate, edit, execute, submit, user, and assistant. Combined with message-type suffixes, these
yield |A|=24 activity symbols (Table 5). Labels derive from the target boolean field.

GUI-Odyssey (Lu et al., 2025) contains 7,735 cross-app mobile GUI navigation episodes across 201 apps on 6 Android
devices. Each step records an action type (CLICK, TEXT, SCROLL, LONG PRESS, COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE), yielding
6 activities. Labels derive from episode success: COMPLETE (7,486 successes) vs. INCOMPLETE (249 failures). This is
our largest mobile-GUI dataset and produces the highest compression ratio (3,036×).

C.1. Cross-Model Transfer
The tau2-bench datasets contain traces from four LLMs executing identical tasks, enabling cross-model FSM transferability
analysis. For each source-target model pair, we build an FSM from the source model’s training traces and evaluate replay

fitness and failure prediction AUROC on the target model’s test traces.


Structural transfer. A single FSM built from all four models’ traces achieves 1.000 replay fitness on every model
individually. The behavioral topology is model-invariant: all models traverse the same tool-call sequences, differing only in
transition probabilities.


Failure prediction transfer (3 suites). Augmented with the FSM cross-entropy anomaly features (Section 4.3), the feature
set produces moderate transfer. We measure on all three tau2-bench suites with 4 LLMs each (12 off-diagonal pairs per
suite, 36 pairs total).

The transfer gap is consistent across suites (range 0.05–0.15), and cross-AUROC remains ≥0.68 in mean on every suite,
meaningfully above chance. GPT-4.1→o4-mini is the strongest cross-pair (telecom 0.950, airline 0.890, retail 0.792);
o4-mini→Claude 3.7 is the weakest on airline and retail (0.560, 0.544), whereas on telecom every cross-pair stays
≥0.82. Per-model FSMs reach 0.999–1.000 self-fitness on all three suites (40–41 states each on telecom, matching airline
and retail). The combined all-model FSM in every suite reaches 1.000 fitness on each model individually, monitoring
heterogeneous deployments without per-model retraining. Transition probabilities under the source model’s FSM remain
partially informative when the target model’s surface behavior differs, because the surprise signal − log2 P (at | qt ) tracks
structural anomalies rather than model-specific tokens; the residual gap reflects that per-model failure modes are partly
model-specific.

D. Baselines and Implementation
We compare against three categories of baselines, each representing a distinct approach to behavioral model extraction.
Automata learning (RPNI, EDSM, Alergia): classic algorithms that infer DFAs or probabilistic automata from traces. RPNI
and EDSM require negative examples for effective merging; without them, they produce near-complete prefix trees (103 –105
states). Alergia uses statistical compatibility testing but still overestimates state counts by 1–6×. Process mining (Heuristic,
Inductive, Alpha Miner via PM4Py): discover Petri nets from event logs. The miners achieve high fitness by accepting all
orderings of observed activities, but this permissiveness yields low precision (0.23–0.69). Workflow extraction (AWM):
extracts linear workflows from successful traces via longest common subsequence alignment. AWM cannot represent cycles
or branching and requires success labels, so it applies only to labeled datasets.

Small-alphabet datasets (|A|=7–9). All three converge within 5–10% of training data and stabilize at 8–10 states. Alergia
matches our state count exactly; HMM confirms the same structure. RPNI produces 476–11,631 states with degraded fitness
(≤0.984), demonstrating that modest trace corpora cause catastrophic overfitting without structural merging.

                                                  Automata from Agent Traces

RPNI completely collapses on AgentNet (62,495 states, 0.743 fitness). WebArena is the exception: short traces (∼8 steps)
keep the prefix tree small (382 states), so RPNI achieves perfect fitness, though still 15× larger. Alergia diverges most on
GUI-Odyssey (3.4× our state count), where the statistical merge criterion becomes overly conservative with 7,735 traces.

Multi-model benchmarks (4 LLMs per dataset). A single FSM achieves 1.000 fitness on all four models’ traces, confirming
model-invariant behavioral topology. tau2-bench telecom has the largest FSM (43 states, 42 tool types), reflecting the
complex diagnostic workflow. The evolution figures show that all three tau2-bench datasets reach structural convergence
despite pooling traces from GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7, GPT-4.1-mini, and o4-mini.

Alergia behavior. Alergia (Carrasco & Oncina, 1994) learns a probabilistic DFA (PDFA) from positive examples using a
Hoeffding bound to decide state merges. On smaller datasets (≤500 traces), Alergia produces state counts matching our
method (8–12 states). On larger datasets, Alergia diverges: 35 states on SWE-agent (1.4× ours) and 24 on GUI-Odyssey
(3.4× ours), because the statistical test becomes more conservative with more data, splitting states that share structure but
differ in probability distributions. Our structural merging is agnostic to transition frequencies, producing deterministic FSMs
that are smaller and faster to construct.

HMM behavior. HMM (Baum-Welch (Rabiner, 1989)) with the same number of hidden states as our FSM achieves
comparable fitness on all twelve datasets. However, HMM states are latent (unlabeled), making the model non-interpretable:
one cannot inspect which behavioral mode a state corresponds to or extract per-state features for downstream analysis. Our
FSM states have explicit activity-labeled transitions.

EDSM behavior. EDSM (Lang et al., 1998) uses evidence-driven scoring to rank candidate merges. Without negative
examples, the evidence score for every merge candidate is zero, so EDSM greedily merges all states into one. The resulting
1-state universal acceptor has perfect fitness (it accepts everything) but zero precision. This validates that our approach, which
also uses only positive examples, achieves meaningful structure (7–43 states with high precision) rather than collapsing.

AWM behavior. AWM (Wang et al., 2025d) by default filters for successful traces only. On Who and When (all failures)
and Mind2Web (no success labels), we use AWM-all which skips the success filter. AWM extracts linear workflows via
longest common subsequence alignment; it cannot represent cycles or branching. Its coverage metric (0.887–1.000) is not
directly comparable to replay fitness.

D.3. Implementation Details
All experiments use a single fixed seed for train/test splitting via seeded Fisher-Yates shuffle. The 80/20 split is applied
consistently across all datasets and baselines.

baselines (Heur., Ind.) achieve competitive fitness but with low precision (Table 18).


RPNI. TypeScript implementation with a 120-second timeout for the merge phase. Without negative examples, RPNI
cannot safely merge states, resulting in near-complete prefix trees. The timeout is necessary for SWE-agent (59,510 states),
GUI-Odyssey (21,255 states), and SWE-smith (11,631 states).

EDSM. AALpy (Muškardin et al., 2022) version 1.3.4. Without negative examples, evidence-driven scoring produces no
merge candidates, collapsing to a 1-state universal acceptor.

Alergia. AALpy implementation with Markov Chain automaton type and ε = 0.005 (Hoeffding bound parameter). Lower
ε produces more merging (fewer states). Alergia learns from positive examples only using statistical compatibility testing.

HMM. Pure NumPy implementation of Baum-Welch EM (Rabiner, 1989) with 50 iterations and scaled forward-backward
to prevent numerical underflow. Number of hidden states set to match our FSM’s state count for fair comparison. Replay
fitness is computed via Viterbi decoding: a symbol is consumed if the decoded state has nonzero emission probability
(> 10−6 ). Effective transitions are counted as entries in the transition matrix with probability > 0.01.

PM4Py. Traces are converted to XES event log format. We run Alpha Miner, Inductive Miner, and Heuristic Miner with
default parameters. Fitness and precision are computed via PM4Py’s conformance checking.

AWM. We re-implement workflow extraction from Wang et al. (2025d). Coverage is measured via longest common
subsequence alignment.

  Failure prediction. Feature selection uses L1-regularized logistic regression (C = 0.1) on the training set to select
  features with non-zero weights. Final models use class-weighted loss (inverse frequency). Cross-validation uses stratified
  5-fold with 10 repetitions, evaluated on training data only (no test data in CV folds).

  Runtime. FSM construction completes in <1 second for all datasets. RPNI requires up to 120 seconds (timeout). PM4Py
  baselines complete in 5–30 seconds.

  D.5. Case Study: FSM Visualizations
 We visualize FSMs for representative datasets to show the behavioral structure our method recovers.

  D.5.1. C USTOMER S ERVICE AGENT ( TAU 2- BENCH AIRLINE )
  Figure 5 illustrates the tau2-bench airline FSM at role-level granularity (6 states, |A|=5). The full tool-level FSM (18 states,
  |A|=17, Table 1) decomposes further into per-tool states. At role level, the FSM reveals two distinct behavioral loops:


  1. Tool-call loop (assistant:tool call ↔ tool:text): The agent queries customer databases (get reservation,
     search flights) and receives structured responses. This loop executes 2–8 times per trace.
  2. Conversation loop (assistant:text → user:text): The agent communicates results to the user and receives
     follow-up requests. Failed traces show more conversation turns (mean 4.2 vs 2.8 for successes), which suggests the agent
     struggles to complete the task.

                                                                         22

<!-- page break -->

                                                Automata from Agent Traces

The FSM makes these patterns structurally visible: the tool-call loop appears as a tight 2-state cycle; the conversation loop
passes through the user state. This decomposition enables per-state analysis (e.g., error rates in the tool state, message
lengths in the assistant state) that raw trace analysis obscures.

Figure 12. SWE-smith FSM (10 states, 17 transitions). The core cycle is bash→tool→edit→tool→bash: agents execute
commands, inspect results, make edits, and repeat. The submit state is a terminal action reached after successful editing.


The SWE-smith FSM (Figure 12) captures the coding agent’s workflow across 10 states.                                       The
bash→tool→str replace editor→tool cycle dominates: the agent executes bash commands, inspects
output, applies code edits, and verifies results. Failed traces (123/500) show higher visit counts in the edit-tool loop (mean
8.4 vs 5.1 for successes) and elevated error rates in the str replace editor state (0.31 vs 0.12), which suggests
repeated failed edit attempts.

D.5.3. C ODING AGENT AT S CALE (SWE- AGENT )
The SWE-agent FSM has 25 states derived from 2,000 traces with 175 raw commands grouped into 7 categories. The larger
state space (compared to SWE-smith’s 10) reflects the richer command vocabulary and longer traces (mean 87 steps vs 23).
Key structural features include:


• A search-navigate cycle (search ↔ navigate): agents find relevant files and navigate to specific locations.
• An edit-execute cycle (edit ↔ execute): agents modify code and run tests.
• A submit terminal: successful traces reach the submit state, the strongest failure-prediction feature.


The 2,380× compression (59,510 RPNI states → 25 FSM states) demonstrates that even agents with complex command
vocabularies exhibit a small number of distinct behavioral modes when commands are grouped by semantic function.

E. Failure Analysis
E.1. Structural Divergence of Success vs. Failure
Separate FSMs for successful and failed traces reveal qualitative structural differences: on SWE-agent, the success FSM
uses only 9 of 25 states with 16 transitions (focused path: search-edit-execute-submit), while the failure FSM spans all
25 states with 60 transitions (chaotic exploration). The transition Jaccard similarity is 0.206, indicating largely disjoint
behavioral structures; all 16 failure-only states correspond to rare tool output parsing variants (e.g., user:tool:of,
user:versioneer) that successful traces never encounter: on tau2-bench, both classes produce structurally identical
FSMs (discrimination gap = 0), which confirms that failure on constrained API-calling tasks manifests purely in transition
frequencies rather than novel states. Failed traces are consistently longer across all datasets (+29 steps on SWE-agent, +18
on SWE-smith) but visit the same or fewer unique states, suggesting that failure shows up as cycling through familiar states
rather than exploring new ones.
These structural differences enable simple monitoring rules without ML models: on SWE-agent, “cycle rate > 0.885”
achieves 95.6% precision (§G.3).

no FSM-D gain, consistent with the discriminative signal being a property of the agent’s behavioral divergence rather than a
universal lift. The FSM-D variant is a complement to the cross-entropy anomaly features used in the main results: where
outgoing distributions diverge, FSM-D contributes a training-free signal; where they do not, the main pipeline’s per-state
visit features and the trace cross-entropy carry the predictive load.

E.5. Failure Prediction Feature Analysis
Table 16 presents the top 10 features by absolute L1-regularized logistic regression weight for each labeled dataset.

Interpretable patterns.     The features reveal consistent failure signals across datasets:

• Not reaching terminal states (SWE-agent: submit state weight +0.29): failed agents get stuck in intermediate loops.
• Elevated error rates (SWE-smith: editor error rate −0.20): failed agents encounter more errors per state.
• Verbose responses (tau2-bench airline: avgMsgLen:assistant): longer responses correlate with task difficulty and failure.
• Temporal entropy (SWE-smith: lateHalfEntropy −0.19): chaotic second-half behavior shows the agent struggling.

activities + length + entropy) vs. FSM per-state features. All models use
embed/hidden=64/128, class weighting, early stopping (patience 10), and
the same 10×5-fold CV protocol. Across this appendix, we retain SWE-smith’s numbers even when they are the weakest
per-dataset value: the dataset is synthetic and below the sample threshold of Proposition 6, so its weaker AUROCs (0.62–0.72
across sub-ablations) are both expected and consistent with the main-text framing that FSM features generalize more strongly
to real LLM-deployment traces.
FSM features improve every neural model on every dataset for MLP and GRU (7/7), and 6/7 for Transformer: the largest
gains appear on tau2-bench retail (+5.3pp MLP, +9.1pp GRU) and AgentNet (+4.2pp MLP, +4.0pp GRU), where the FSM’s
per-state decomposition localizes behavioral differences that aggregate statistics miss. The Transformer loss on SWE-agent
(−2.8pp) occurs where the small alphabet (24 symbols) limits the FSM’s decomposition advantage. The improvement is
consistent regardless of dataset size (500–8,337 traces): even on WebArena (8,337 traces), FSM features provide +1.3pp
(MLP), +1.7pp (GRU), and +0.8pp (Transformer), demonstrating that the FSM captures structural information beyond what
large-sample statistics recover.

shows that most single-activity changes violate the learned transition structure. Deletion is weakest on tau2-bench datasets
(61–80%) because shorter traces are more likely to remain valid prefixes. These results demonstrate that the compact FSM
imposes tight structural constraints: even single-symbol perturbations are detected, because the transition function encodes
which activity can follow which, not merely which activities are valid. For example, on tau2-bench airline, swapping
user:text↔assistant:tool:get reservation details at position 3 is immediately rejected: after state
assistant:text, the only valid transition is user:text (the user must respond before the agent can call a tool). On
SWE-agent, swapping navigate:text↔user:text fails because self-transitions back to user:text are not in the
FSM’s transition table. These rejections reflect genuine turn-taking and tool-invocation constraints that the FSM learns from
data.

See Appendix H.4 for additional failure mode characterization including cascade analysis and early divergence detection.

F. Convergence and Structural Properties
F.1. Convergence Details
Fitness converges rapidly as training traces are   Table 21. Convergence and generalization. Left: fraction at which fit-
added: on all datasets, fitness reaches 0.99 with  ness reaches 0.99. Right: train−test fitness gap at increasing fractions (all
5–15% of training data (Figures 1, 14). On         within ±0.003). Convergence behavior is similar across extraction levels (Ap-
                                                   pendix G.2).
SWE-agent (2,000 traces), fitness reaches 0.99
at 240 traces (15%), though the state space                                 Convergence            Gen. gap (train−test)
grows to 25 as rare command patterns appear.             Dataset      Train 0.99 at Frac |Q|  10%     30%        60%     100%

so a fixed corpus yields a unique FSM; across            SWE-smith      400     40 10% 10 −0.002 −0.001           0      −0.001

                                                         SWE-agent    1,600    240 15% 25 −0.002 −0.001 −0.001 +0.001
few states of the full-data value (rare activities
present in only some samples account for the
residual), whereas RPNI state counts vary by 2–10% (Appendix F.2).
Table 21 reports the training fraction at which fitness first reaches 0.99, the final state count, and the generalization gap
(train − test fitness) at increasing training fractions.
Smaller datasets converge at 5% of training data; SWE-agent requires 15% to capture rare commands. All generalization
gaps are within ±0.003, confirming zero overfitting. Slightly negative gaps arise because training sets include rare transitions
that reduce average fitness.

F.2. Stability and SCC Structure
The construction is deterministic and hyperparameter-free (Theorem 3): a fixed training corpus yields a unique FSM, so
re-extraction is exactly reproducible. Across random train/test splits our FSM state counts stay within a few states of the
full-data value; the residual reflects rare activities (e.g. SWE-agent’s late-appearing commands) that occur in only some 80%
samples, whereas RPNI state counts vary by 2–10% (hundreds to thousands of states). Structurally, every FSM decomposes
into one large strongly-connected component (the behavioral core) and a short prefix; the condensation DAG is shallow
(depth 2–4), and init→setup→core traces the universal agent lifecycle. SCC-based features achieve AUROC 0.60–0.66:
failures tend to become trapped in the core loop rather than progressing to terminal states.

F.3. Entropy Rate Analysis
We estimate the conditional entropy H(Xn | Xn−1 , . . . , Xn−k ) of the activity sequence at increasing orders k to characterize
the sequential structure of agent traces. Table 22 shows the entropy rate convergence across all datasets.
Table 22. Conditional entropy (bits) by context order.    On all datasets, entropy drops 51–68% from order 0 to 1 (Ta-
The large drop from order 0→1 and convergence by order    ble 22), and order-2 vs. order-3 estimates differ by <0.02 bits on
2–3 shows strong sequential regularity.                   2/3 datasets: the drop shows that agent behavior is predominantly
                                                          determined by the immediately preceding action, which explains

  Mind2Web 1.69 0.74 0.79 0.68            56%
                                                          vs. failure entropy rates are nearly identical (within 0.03 bits), in-
                                                          dicating shared behavioral topology with differences in transition
frequencies.

F.4. Feature Redundancy Analysis
We compute pairwise Pearson correlations among 14 structural features to identify redundancy. We group features with
|r| > 0.8 into clusters, and a greedy selection retains the feature with highest individual AUROC from each cluster.
Across labeled datasets, 14 features consistently collapse into 5–8 non-redundant clusters: the largest cluster (5–7 features)

contains {traceLen, logLength, entropy, transitionDiversity, maxConsecRatio, recurrenceRate}; these are all manifestations
of trace length and its correlates. Removing all redundant features and retaining only one representative per cluster yields
combined AUROC of 0.655 (SWE-smith) and 0.713 (SWE-agent): on SWE-agent, the non-redundant subset achieves 90%
of the full-feature AUROC, so the failure prediction signal is genuine and concentrated in a small number of independent
behavioral dimensions: cycle structure, state entropy, and terminal state reachability.

On SWE-agent, FSM features outperform baselines by +0.026 to +0.257 at all stages.
On SWE-smith, the simpler FSM offers no consistent advantage, suggesting that the
FSM benefit scales with behavioral complexity.

                                                          dataset. These rules require only FSM replay (0.006 ms/trace) with
                                                          no model training. On SWE-agent, the cycle-rate rule achieves
95.6% precision (near-zero false alarm rate) at the cost of lower recall (45.1%). SWE-smith shows weaker monitoring rules,
consistent with its lower failure prediction AUROC in the ML-based approach (Table 14).

drops fitness to 0.63–0.82 across datasets and yields AUROC ≥0.917 for distinguishing clean from perturbed traces. Within
a single dataset, success and failure traces exhibit structural divergence: on SWE-agent, the success-only FSM has 9 states
(focused: search-edit-submit) while the failure-only FSM spans all 25 states (chaotic exploration with rare tool variants).
The FSM captures behavioral topology, not vocabulary.

G.5. Probabilistic Baseline Comparison
Table 26 compares FSM per-state features against probabilistic baselines for failure prediction: Markov chain cross-entropy
(CE) against success/failure transition matrices, likelihood ratio (LR) scoring, and discriminative n-gram frequency analysis.

FSM features dominate on SWE-agent (+0.19 over the best probabilistic baseline), where the per-state decomposition cap-
tures structural information that aggregate transition statistics miss. On SWE-smith, transition cross-entropy is competitive
(0.719 vs. 0.718): the simpler FSM (10 states) offers less decomposition advantage. Probabilistic models capture how often
transitions occur but not what happens at each state (message lengths, error rates, temporal patterns). The FSM provides
both: its deterministic structure supports per-state feature extraction, while probabilistic models reduce each trace to a single
scalar score.

G.6. ProbGuard Head-to-Head Comparison
We implement ProbGuard (Wang et al., 2025b) on the same activity sequences, labels, and 80/20 splits for a like-for-like
comparison, reproducing its pipeline (Algorithms 1–2): symbolic-state abstraction, DTMC learning with Laplace smoothing
(α=1), bounded reachability P≤θ [ F ≤k unsafe ] by finite-horizon Bellman iteration, and a per-trace risk score equal to the
maximum reachability along the trajectory. Its published evaluation uses hand-crafted predicates (fork in microwave
∧ microwave on); no such predicates exist for general LLM agent traces, so we follow its “extensible domain-specific
abstraction” interface and take the activity itself as the symbolic state. To avoid handicapping the baseline we grant
it every configuration advantage: log-odds ranking of unsafe states, sweeps over Kunsafe ∈ {1, 3, 5, 10} and horizon
k ∈ {3, 5, 10, 20, 50}, and a polarity flip max(AUROC, 1−AUROC); we report the best of the resulting 20 configurations
per dataset.

Table 27. ProbGuard (Wang et al., 2025b) vs. our FSM features for failure prediction. ProbGuard column = best AUROC over 20
configurations (Kunsafe× horizon, polarity-aware); FSM column = holdout AUROC from Table 14. Our FSM wins on every shared dataset

Two factors drive the gap: without ProbGuard’s hand-crafted predicates the symbolic-state abstraction collapses to per-
activity granularity, which leaves each state with too few visits for reliable reachability estimation; and our cross-entropy
anomaly features (− log2 P̂ + (at | qt )) give a continuous per-step risk score, whereas ProbGuard’s PCTL-thresholded
reachability is binary at deployment. ProbGuard’s strength on its own benchmarks (autonomous driving, embodied agents)
comes from those domain predicates; on general agent traces the FSM cross-entropy approach generalises further. The
methods are complementary: a PCTL specification could be layered on our compact FSM (Theorem 3) to combine its
structural constraints with formal reachability checking.

G.7. Perturbation Robustness
Table 28 presents fitness degradation under four perturbation types at 10% intensity across all datasets. Substitution
(replacing activities with random same-alphabet symbols) causes the largest fitness drop, which confirms that the FSM
captures transition topology rather than vocabulary.
Substitution is the strongest perturbation because it introduces                   Table 28. Fitness under 10% perturbation intensity. Baseline

G.9. Next-Step Prediction
Order-1 FSM conditioning (Our FSM) captures 83–99% of the total CE improvement from Uniform to the best method
on each dataset, reflecting the strong sequential regularity of agent traces. Higher-order context via PPM smoothing or
neural models captures the remaining second- and higher-order dependencies within each FSM state. The FSM state benefit
(+0.019 bits avg, FSM-LR vs. NGram-LR at K=7) is largest on Mind2Web (+0.041) and Who and When (+0.028), where
the FSM groups behaviorally distinct states. On SWE-agent (+0.001), the FSM state is nearly redundant with the last activity
due to simple sequential structure.
RPNI produces worse-than-Unigram predictions on most datasets. With 382–63,897 states, each state is visited by too
few traces for reliable probability estimation. This validates the compression advantage: our 10–43 state FSMs aggregate
observations for well-estimated transition probabilities. MLPs diverge on larger alphabets (|A| ≥ 9; CE > 10 bits) from
gradient instability, while RNNs without BPTT fail uniformly (CE > 1.4). Echo state networks avoid both issues through
random frozen reservoirs with trained output layers, achieving competitive performance with minimal hyperparameter
sensitivity.

FSM state ablation. Holding the smoothing method fixed (absolute discounting at depth 5), FSM state conditioning
provides +0.155 bits improvement on average over raw context alone (FSM-AD: 0.580 vs. Pure-AD: 0.735). The advantage
is largest on Mind2Web (+0.36 bits, 30%) where the FSM groups heterogeneous web actions, and smallest on SWE-agent
(+0.016 bits, 2%) where the simple sequential structure makes FSM state nearly redundant with the last activity. This gap is
larger than the +0.019 bits from FSM-LR vs. NGram-LR (Table 2), because logistic regression partially learns FSM-like
state from raw context.

sample size (1,600 training traces). In practice, FSM-based failure predic-
tion can be deployed with as few as 16–160 labeled traces, which makes it
viable for new agent systems where labeled data is scarce.

H.3. Length vs. Structure Ablation
On SWE-agent, structural features alone reach AUROC 0.790, length alone only 0.659, and the full model 0.790: adding
length to the structural features changes full-model AUROC by <0.001, confirming that the predictive signal is structural
rather than a length proxy.

H.4. Failure Mode Characterization
On SWE-agent, the two failure modes are structurally distinct: “stuck in edit loop” traces have cycle rate 0.924 and terminate
in edit:text (50%), while “gave up early” traces have lower cycle rate (0.755) and reach submit:text (98.7%) but
still fail. The discriminating feature with highest F-ratio is: visit:user:text (7.41 on SWE-agent).

H.4.1. FAILURE C ASCADE A NALYSIS
We analyze whether failures develop gradually (progressive fitness degradation) or suddenly (abrupt state change). Across
all datasets, 97% of SWE-agent failures are sudden (1,292 of 1,329), with no gradual degradation pattern. This is consistent
across datasets: SWE-smith 100% sudden. Failure monitoring should therefore focus on detecting specific state patterns
(e.g., cycle rate threshold) rather than tracking gradual performance decline.

H.4.2. FAILURE P ROGRESSION
Failure signatures emerge early in execution: on SWE-agent, the first divergence between success and failure
state distributions occurs at 8.7% of trace length (position 0.087). Divergence occurs at 15.4% on SWE-smith.
tool:text→assistant:text is the highest-lift failure transition on SWE-smith (fail rate 0.90, lift 3.66× over
base rate). Recovery from failure-indicative states is possible: SWE-agent has 8 recovery states where traces can return to
successful trajectories, with 95.7% recovery rate within 2 steps.

H.5. Counterfactual Path Analysis
We identify FSM decision points where success and failure paths diverge, measured by Jensen-Shannon divergence of
outgoing transition distributions.
On SWE-agent, failures show 5.4× more unique paths than suc-               Table 32. Counterfactual path analysis. Decision points:

H.6. Compression Theory
Table 33 presents information-theoretic analysis of FSM compression across all datasets. FSM bits count the encoded
transition table; raw bits count log2 |A| per activity summed over all traces, so the MDL ratio measures how much of the
raw description the FSM eliminates.
The FSM achieves MDL ratios of 0.001–0.008 across all              Table 33. Information-theoretic compression analysis. MDL:

H.7. Path Diversity and Recurrence Analysis
Table 34 quantifies path diversity and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) metrics across datasets: RQA treats activity
sequences as symbolic time series.
82% of traces follow unique FSM paths on coding agent datasets, yet the FSM compresses all into 6–25 states with
≥0.999 fitness by capturing transition topology rather than memorizing paths. API-driven domains show opposite extremes:
tau2-bench telecom has only 5 unique paths across 1,824 traces (highly constrained workflows), while tau2-bench retail has
1,521 unique paths (73.2% singletons). RQA metrics achieve 0.60–0.70 AUROC on coding agents, with diagonal entropy
strongest on SWE-agent (0.704), but are weaker on web/GUI benchmarks (0.31–0.47 on GUI-Odyssey and AgentNet)
where trace structures are less recurrent.

                                                                                               33

On coding agents, failed traces contain 1.4–2.2× more loops, strongest on SWE-agent (2.17×, 54.8 vs. 25.3 backedges,
AUROC 0.665). Interestingly, on web/GUI benchmarks the pattern reverses: successful WebArena traces loop more (9.9
vs. 6.4, ratio 0.65×), which reflects productive exploration in complex navigation tasks. tau2-bench airline shows the
strongest signal among API agents (1.26×, AUROC 0.664). Graph motif analysis reveals that tau2-bench airline/retail have
the densest bidirectional structure (14–15 pairs), while triangles appear only in Who&When (6, multi-agent delegation),
GUI-Odyssey (6, cross-app navigation), and tau2-bench telecom (2).

H.13. Agent Integration: Runtime Monitor
Figure 4 (body) shows the cycle-rate trajectory contrast between a failing and a successful SWE-agent run. The failing trace
enters a cycle between user and edit states; cycle-rate exceeds 0.778 at step 11 (31% of this specific trace; mean across
all interventions: 32%), triggering early termination. The successful trace visits 7 distinct states and reaches submit; its

cycle-rate peaks at 0.636 and never crosses the threshold. Monitor F1 = 0.904 on SWE-agent without any trained model.
We simulate deploying the FSM as a runtime monitor that replays agent actions step-by-step and triggers intervention
when learned rules fire. Rules are automatically derived from training traces: cycle-rate thresholds (percentile-based) and
minimum unique-state counts, with a warm-up period (10% of mean trace length) before activation. A “stuck” detector also
fires when the agent remains in the same state for 5+ consecutive steps.

The monitor is reliable on FSMs with high structural diversity (|Q| ≥ 6 active states with distinct failure patterns): SWE-
agent (F1 = 0.904, lift 1.02×) and tau2-bench airline (F1 = 0.776, lift 1.27×). On the smaller-alphabet datasets, the
rule under-discriminates: tau2-bench retail and SWE-smith FSMs are too coarse for cycle-rate to separate failure modes,
and the monitor over-triggers. The two-dataset F1 ≥ 0.776 result establishes a working operating regime; deploying on
small-alphabet domains requires per-dataset rule tuning.
